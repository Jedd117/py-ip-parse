# py-ip-parse
parse IP addresses from a txt file


## To use
- Clone the repo and cd into it
- run `python .\sort-ip NAME_OF_FILE.txt`
- report will be generated as `NAME_OF_FILE-report.txt`

example:
```
python .\sort-ip.py .\logs.txt

```


There's an example file called `logs.txt` which is similar to what you might find in apache logs.
